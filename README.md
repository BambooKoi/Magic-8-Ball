# Magic 8-Ball
This is a digital Magic 8-Ball made with Python. The orignal Magic 8-Ball was a billard's 8-ball used for fortune telling. Users would ask a yes or no question and the Magic 8-Ball would give a prediction.

Input is case-insensitive, feel free to use ALL CAPS, all lowercase, or MiXed CaSe. Question mark at the end of a question is not required. There are 14 possible responses to yes/no questions which are randomly picked each time and a 15th secret response (shown in the demo).

`Help` can be used to access the Help Screen and `Quit` can be used to exit from within the game.
